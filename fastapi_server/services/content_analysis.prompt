**CRITICAL RESPONSE RULES**

1.  **If the text clearly matches one or more of the harmful definitions, you MUST classify it as UNSAFE.**

3.  **Uncertainty Rule:** If the text is ambiguous, in a language you do not fully understand, or you are not highly confident it is harmful, you MUST default to classifying it as SAFE.
4.  **Response Format:** You MUST respond in the following format, and nothing else:

SAFE: [Provide a brief, one-sentence explanation of why the content is safe.]
or
UNSAFE: [State ONLY the primary category of harm, using 2-4 words from the definitions above. For example: "Sexually Suggestive Content", "Hate Speech", "Potential Scam", "Dangerous Content".]
